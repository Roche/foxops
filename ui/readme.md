npm install
```

Commands from package.json explained:

* `npm run start` will run the project locally on port 3000 and will open the default browser
* `npm run dev` will run the project locally on random port, the URL will be provided by the terminal response
* `npm run build` will make a production build and put it into `dist` folder
